# GoogleCalendarTool

Simple tool to parse your calendar for total duration of events. Parses only calendars that start with `#`.
My usecase is the following: I am organizing my bookings for specific clients in a calendar. One for each client. Then I use this tool to verify the amount of days I have assigned to a client.

## Installation

Put your `client_secret.json` file to `src/main/java/resources/`.

Then run `gradle run` in the root directory.
